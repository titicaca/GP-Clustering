# GP-Clustering

In this project, we develop an understanding of the idea for clustering with Gaussian process models, according to the work of Hyun-Chul Kim and Jaewook Lee. Based on that, we implement a Gaussian Process Clustering Python Package, and perform some clustering tests with different datasets.


More details about this project can be found in the [report](

		results -- stores the clustering results of ACT Schools
		
	1.2. Notebook:
	
		GPClustering_Impl.ipynb  -- Implementation of GPClustering Package
		
		GPClustering_Variance.ipynb -- Variance Test with Differernt Covariance Function Parameters
		
		GPClustering_Test.ipynb -- GP Clustering Test with different datasets 
		
		GPClustering_Test_HighDimension.ipynb -- GP Clustering Test with high dimensional dataset
		
		KMeans_Test.ipynb -- KMeans Clustering Test with different datasets
		
	1.3 Other Files:
	
		GPClustering.py -- The python package of our implemented GPClustering, which can be exported in notebook GPClustering_Impl.ipynb  
		
		schools.html -- The Clustering Application of ACT Schools

2. HOW TO:

	2.1. Intallation of Ipython notebook
	A installation Guide: http://ipython.org/install.html
	
	2.2. Install Python Dependency Packages if some needed packages are missing

	2.3. Go to the root path of the project, and start ipython notebook with the command:
	>ipython notebook
	
	2.4. Open notebooks and run the codes (for some big dataset, the clustering test might take some time..)
	The Package GPClustering.py which is used in clustering test can be re-downloaded in the notebook GPClustering_Impl.ipynb, if it is missing
	
	2.5. Open schools.html with IE Explore to see the Application of ACT Schools (Chrome and Firefox cannot work beause of ActiveX) 

3. Dataset Download: 

Shape Sets: R15, path-based2:spiral
UCI datasets: Iris
